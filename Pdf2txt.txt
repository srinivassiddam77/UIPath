Dear Pete,
Permit me co introduce you to the facility of facsimile
transmission.
In facsimile a photocell is caused to perform a raster scan over
the subject copy. The variations of print density on the docurnent
cause the photocell to generate an analogous electrical video signal.
This signal is used to a carrier, which is transmitted to a
remote destination over a radio or cable cormnunications link.
At the remote terminal, demodulation reconstructs the video
signal, which is used to modulate che density of print produced by a
printing device. lhis device is scanning in a raster scan synchronised
with that at the transmitting terminal. As a result, a facsimile
copy of the subject document is produced.
Probably you have uses for this facility in your organisation.
Yours sincerely,
P. J. CROSS
